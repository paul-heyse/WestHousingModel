## 1. Implementation

- [x] 1.1 Define site feature schema (hazards, proximities, ops flags) + provenance
- [x] 1.2 Implement hazard/proximity transforms (FEMA, USFS wildfire, USGS seismic, NOAA normals/storms, proximities)
- [x] 1.3 Validate with Pandera; write provenance sidecar
- [x] 1.4 Tests: unit (flag logic), integration with tiny fixtures
