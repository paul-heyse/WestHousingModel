## ADDED Requirements

### Requirement: Comprehensive Test Coverage

The project SHALL maintain a layered testing strategy covering unit, integration, and golden scenarios for connectors, repository behavior, and valuation pipelines.

#### Scenario: Unit coverage for logging and connectors
- **WHEN** new logging or connector logic is introduced
- **THEN** unit tests SHALL assert logging payloads, correlation IDs, schema drift handling, and error messaging.

#### Scenario: Integration coverage for CLI workflows
- **WHEN** CLI refresh/validate commands run in online and offline modes
- **THEN** integration tests SHALL verify structured logging output, stale/fresh indicators, and cache artifacts on disk.

#### Scenario: Golden coverage for valuation pipeline
- **WHEN** feature builders and valuation engines run on curated datasets
- **THEN** golden tests SHALL compare outputs (features, scores, valuation) against checked-in snapshots, failing on regressions.
