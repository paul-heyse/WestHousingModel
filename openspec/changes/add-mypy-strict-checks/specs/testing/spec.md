## ADDED Requirements

### Requirement: Strict Type Enforcement Roadmap

The project SHALL adopt module-scoped strict static typing for critical packages, block unchecked `Any` propagation, and document developer workflows for sustaining the stricter guarantees.

#### Scenario: Per-module strict configuration defined
- **WHEN** the typing configuration is inspected
- **THEN** there SHALL be explicit strict settings (e.g., `warn-return-any`, `disallow-any-generics`) for repository, connectors, features, valuation, and CLI packages
- **AND** new modules SHALL not bypass strict mode without an explicit exclusion noted in the configuration file.

#### Scenario: `type: ignore` usage justified
- **WHEN** a `type: ignore` comment is encountered
- **THEN** it SHALL include the specific error code and a brief justification
- **AND** linting SHALL fail if the justification or code is omitted.

#### Scenario: Developer workflow documented
- **WHEN** contributors run documented commands
- **THEN** they SHALL have access to a reproducible `mypy --strict` invocation (e.g., `make mypy-strict`) and accompanying README/tests documentation describing required environment and remediation steps.
